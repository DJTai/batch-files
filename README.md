# Batch Files

Batch files I use to make daily life a bit easier.

## What are Batch files?

Glad you asked. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file):
> A batch file is a script file in DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft  Windows.

## How are these used?

I store all of these in a folder, say `C:\Users\MyName\Scripts`, and I add that path to my Environment Variables. Then I can type `Win + R`, type the filename, and voila! Magic!
